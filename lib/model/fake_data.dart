        """It seems you're referring to a Tudor Black Bay 58 GMT, but as of now, no official release of a Black Bay 58 model with a GMT function has been announced.

The Tudor Black Bay 58 is renowned for its vintage-inspired design and smaller case size (39mm) compared to the regular Black Bay line. It pays homage to classic dive watches from the 1950s. On the other hand, the Tudor Black Bay GMT is a separate model that features a GMT function (allowing you to track time in two time zones) but has a larger 42mm case.

If you're imagining a combination of the Black Bay 58's compact design with a GMT feature, this specific model doesn’t currently exist in Tudor’s lineup.""",
